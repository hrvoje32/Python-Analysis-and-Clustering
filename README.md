# Python-Analysis-and-Clustering
Advanced Data Analysis and Clustering in E-Commerce Dataset - 
This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of an E-Commerce dataset using Python. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and advanced clustering techniques. Key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn are utilized.



Key Steps and Techniques:



Data Preprocessing:

o	Imported and converted the E-Commerce dataset from text to CSV format.

o	Added column names for clarity and processed the data, including converting gender to binary and handling infinite and missing values.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

o	Conducted descriptive analysis with graphical representations.

o	Analyzed gender distribution, annual income, and spending scores separated by gender.

o	Utilized Matplotlib and Plotly for visualizing data distributions and patterns.



Advanced Data Analysis:

o	Performed correlation analysis to understand the relationships between age, annual income, and spending score.

o	Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and KMeans for clustering.



Clustering and Visualization:

o	Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

o	Executed 3D and 2D clustering visualizations to interpret clusters effectively.

o	Calculated silhouette scores to assess the clustering quality.



Data Standardisation and Scaling:

o	Standardised the data using the StandardScaler.

o	Applied min-max scaling to normalize the dataset.



Results and Insights:

o	Provided detailed insights on customer segmentation based on spending behavior and demographics.

o	Identified key patterns and trends pertinent to e-commerce customer behaviors.
